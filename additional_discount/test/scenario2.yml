- We create a proportional tax (VAT)
- !record {model: account.tax, id: vat}:
    name: VAT
    amount: 0.196
    type: percent
    sequence: 1
    company_id: base.main_company
    type_tax_use: all

- We create a sale order with two lines and 50% discount
- !record {model: sale.order, id: order1}:
    name: DISCOUNT_SO1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_agrolait
    note: Invoice after delivery
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term
    add_disc: 30.0
    order_line:
        - name: DISCOUNT_SOL1
          product_id: product.product_product_mb1
          type: make_to_order
          price_unit: 20.00
          product_uom_qty: 8
          tax_id:
            - additional_discount.vat

        - name: DISCOUNTED_SOL2
          product_id: product.product_product_mb2
          type: make_to_order
          price_unit: 10.00
          product_uom_qty: 4

- The final price should be discounted (20*8*1.196+10*4)*(1-0.3) = 161.95
- !assert {model: sale.order, id: order1}:
    - amount_total == 161.95

- We validate the sale order
- !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order1}

- We create the invoice manually
- !workflow {model: sale.order, action: manual_invoice, ref: order1}

- We should have an invoice with the draft state
- !assert {model: account.invoice, search: "[('origin', '=', 'DISCOUNT_SO1')]", count: 1}

- The created invoice should have a 50% discount and correct taxes
- Both purchase order should not have any discount (or should it?)
- !python {model: account.invoice}: |
